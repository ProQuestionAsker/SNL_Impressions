		<p class="prose">Airing for 42 years, Saturday Night Live is the longest running comedy sketch show in U.S. history. The show's weekly, live format has allowed writers and cast to hold a fun-house mirror up to the most timely topics in American pop culture. Many of these cultural caricatures take the form of impersonations. </p>
		<p class="prose-highlight">6,673 caricatures, to be more precise. </p>
		<p class="prose">But who are these people? Why did the SNL writers feel they were relevant enough to parody? Which people appear in America's cultural gaze for a moment and which have more than 15 minutes of fame?</p>
		<p class="prose">To find out, I dug into the impersonation data for every<sup>*</sup> SNL episode. Here's what I found:</p>
		<p class="prose-note"><sup>*</sup>Up to and including February 4, 2017</p>
		<h3 class="prose-header">Here's what I found</h3>
		<p class="prose">We'll start with...well...everyone. Each of these circles represents one of the
		<span class="prose-highlight-inline">2,603 people</span>
		impersonated on SNL. People with bigger circles were impersonated more times than people with smaller circles.</p>
		<p class="prose">Using information from their Wikipedia pages, I grouped every person into one of three categories:</p>
		<!--<p class="prose-header">Catalyst 1: Hip hop with slang as the title</p>
		<p class="prose-def">Broccoli (noun) - weed</p>-->

			<p class="prose-note">Note on methods: People are complex, and many of them could fall into more than one category. In those cases, I categorized them based on how they were most frequently portrayed on SNL. For example, Donald Trump was a business leader and Reality TV host before becoming a politician. But because most of his portrayals on SNL have satirized his political career, he's classified as a politician here.</p>

		<p class="prose">60% of these impressions were "one-hit wonders", appearing on the show only once. To learn about pop cultural icons, we'll focus on those who were impersonated repeatedly, and more specifically, those that were
		<span class="prose-highlight-inline">impersonated a disproportionate number of times in a year</span>. For example, in 2016, people were typically parodied about 3.5 times each. Donald Trump was impersonated a total of 16 times (4.6 times more than what was "normal" for that year).</p>

		<h3 class="prose-header">So, what can we learn from this?</h3>
		<h4 class="prose-subheading">SNL &lt;3s standing presidents (specifically Bill Clinton)</h4>
		<p class="prose">Bill Clinton holds the SNL award for the most impersonations overall (112!) and the most in a single year (7.5 times more than normal!) But he's not the first standing president to be parodied much more frequently than other people on the show. In fact, every president that has been in office since SNL started has been impersonated disproportionately more than others at some point during their presidency. </p>

		<h4 class="prose-subheading">Don't count on higher-than-usual, targeted, political satire during election years</h4>
		<p class="prose">While SNL does tend to incorporate presidential candidates into their sketches, a single candidate isn't always singled out. In fact, in 1980, 1984, 1992, and 2008, there weren't any people that were impersonated outside of the “normal” range for those years. Among candidates that were singled out, these were featured the most:</p>

	<div class="prose-wrapper">
		<h4 class="prose-subheading">Monica Lewinsky was the most featured “non-politician”</h4>
		<p class="prose">Best known in the public eye as the woman that former president Bill Clinton “did not have sexual relations” with, Ms. Lewinsky was impersonated on SNL frequently in 1998.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="prose-wrapper">
		<h4 class="prose-subheading">If you want to stand-out as an entertainer, become a newscaster or talk-show host</h4>
		<p class="prose">While entertainers made up the largest group of people impersonated on SNL as a whole, over half of them only appeared once. Of the entertainers that were impersonated a disproportionate number of times, newscasters made up 45%. </p>

		<h3 class="prose-header">Headline</h3>
		<p class="prose">American pop culture is complex and always changing. Looking at it through the satire-tinted lens of Saturday Night Live gives insight into a single piece of the puzzle.  </p>
		<p class="prose">So, if you hope to find yourself repeatedly parodied on SNL someday, become a politician, interview them, or cozy up to one. Your chances will be better than most. </p>
